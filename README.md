# icingaplugin-rs

icingaplugin-rs is a collection of utilities useful for writing standardized check plugins for Icinga2 and the likes written in Rust. 
Right now, this library is a heavy work in progress and not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io). This may change in the future.

## Usage
Add the repository as dependency in your project's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "dummy_check_example"
authors = [ "Me <me@mail.com>"]
edition = 2018

[dependencies]
icingaplugin-rs = { git = "https://github.com/NETWAYS/icingaplugin-rs", tag = "v0.0.1"}
```

As mentioned, this is a heavy work in progress and no usage examples will be given right now as they might change at any time. For guidance, take a look at the `docstrings` provided
in the source code (e.g. [check.rs]("src/check.rs")).
